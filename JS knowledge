The javascript is different from other languages

javascript is a dynamically typed language

The concept of scope chain exists in javascript

The concept of hoisting exists in javascript

Every web application which includes a lot of complexity involves javascript

when writing code in javascript , The engine creates a global window object and this keyword

The keyword this refers to global window object under certain circumstances,and it also belongs to that certain object in which it was defined

Many web applications are powered by javascript

javascript is the most widely used programming language

There are many technologies based on the javascript language , such as node js , react js , express js and mongoose and mongo db

Every function when invoked createsa new execution context , on top of the gloal context or the stack

An event loop is a important concept in javascript , which helps run functions asynchronously

javascript is a single threaded language (one process ata time)

The event loop consists of various events , which are pushed on top of the stack , when the stack is empty

The event doesnot get triggered until the execution stack is empty

Functions are also objects in javascript

objects can be created in 3 different ways such as .......{},new Object,var person={}

arrays are collection of objects which can also be created in three different ways .....[],new Array(),var fox=[]

JS is weird but thats what makes it most powerful and different from all the other programming language.
